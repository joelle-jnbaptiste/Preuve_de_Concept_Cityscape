# 🌆 POC – Image Segmentation (Cityscapes)  
### *DeepLabV3+ vs Mask2Former Comparison*

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

This Proof of Concept evaluates and compares two segmentation models — **DeepLabV3+ (baseline)** and **Mask2Former (state-of-the-art)** — on a reduced subset of the **Cityscapes** dataset.  
The project includes a full pipeline: dataset preparation, training with **MLflow**, metrics comparison, a **FastAPI** inference backend, and a **Streamlit** user interface.

## 🧠 Dataset Used — Cityscapes

Cityscapes is a benchmark dataset of annotated urban street scenes.  
For this POC, a **reduced subset (~100 images)** was selected to enable fast experimentation while keeping visual diversity.

---

## ⚙️ Models Evaluated

### 🔵 Baseline — DeepLabV3+ (ResNet50)
- CNN-based architecture with atrous (dilated) convolutions  
- Optimizer: AdamW  
- Fully tracked with MLflow  

### 🟠 Modern Model — Mask2Former (Transformer-based)
- Universal segmentation architecture  
- Masked Attention Transformer decoder  
- Multi-scale high-resolution feature processing  
- Implementation from HuggingFace Transformers  

---

## 📊 Metrics Tracked (via MLflow)

- **Training Loss**  
- **Validation Loss**  
- **Pixel Accuracy**  
- **mIoU (mean Intersection over Union)**  
- **Images per second** (inference throughput)  
- **Training time per epoch**

---

## 📈 Results Summary

| Model            | Pixel Accuracy | mIoU  | Inference Speed (img/s) |
|------------------|----------------|-------|---------------------------|
| DeepLabV3+       | ~0.93          | ~0.64 | ~5.8                      |
| **Mask2Former**  | **~0.95+**     | **~0.77+** | **~6.4**              |

**Key takeaway:**  
👉 **Mask2Former significantly outperforms DeepLabV3+** on all meaningful segmentation metrics while also being slightly faster to train and infer.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Backend (FastAPI)
- Hosts the chosen trained model  
- Provides `/predict` endpoint for segmentation masks  
- Lightweight CPU-friendly preprocessing pipeline  

### Frontend (Streamlit)
- Upload an image  
- Visualize predicted segmentation  
- Compare DeepLabV3+ vs Mask2Former  
- Accessible UI with WCAG-compliant colors and alt-text descriptions
